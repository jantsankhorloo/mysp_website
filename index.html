			<h2>What is MYSP?</h2>
			<p>The Mongolian Young Scholars Program (MYSP) is a weeklong intensive academic program intended to introduce Mongolian high school students to university-level liberal arts courses and provide guidance on the global college-admission process. At MYSP, students are exposed to the values of a liberal arts education provided through seminars taught by current Mongolian and international college students from top universities around the world, including Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Brown, and Princeton. Along with daily seminars, MYSP also includes daily college prep sessions on SAT, university selection, financial aid, college essay writing, and the admission process.  </p>

			<p>The program was established in 2011. In 2013, <a href="http://zorigsan.mn/en/" target="_blank">Zorig Foundation</a> assumed responsibility for implementing the program. The Zorig Foundation is a Mongolian non-governmental organization dedicated to strengthen human rights, political freedom, social justice, good governance and democratic values in Mongolian society. </p>
