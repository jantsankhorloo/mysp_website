	<h3>Our Mission</h3>
	<p>The Mongolian Young Scholars Program aims to identify and prepare promising Mongolian high school students for admission to leading
U.S. and international universities.</p>

	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>
The majority of Mongolian high schools currently lack formal processes for college counseling. Currently, most schools can only provide students with extra tutoring sessions for entrance exams required for admission to local universities. Although a growing number of Mongolian high school students would like to pursue higher education overseas, they lack the guidance and often do not know where to turn for advice. </p>
<p>
Mongolian Young Scholars Program (MYSP) will help address this need and contribute to the development of a high caliber Mongolian workforce. By providing MYSP students with a high-caliber academic experience in liberal arts, MYSP participants gain an opportunity to sharpen their analytical reasoning, writing, and leadership skills, and improve their chances of success to enter and graduate from global leading universities. </p>
<p>
The Mongolian Young Scholars Program is a weeklong intensive academic program intended to introduce Mongolian high school students to university-level liberal arts courses and provide guidance on the global college-admission process. At MYSP, students are exposed to the values of a liberal arts education provided through seminars taught by current Mongolian and international college students from top universities around the world, including Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Brown, and Princeton. Along with daily seminars, MYSP also includes daily college prep sessions on SAT, university selection, financial aid, college essay writing, and the admission process.  </p>
<p>
The program was established in 2011 by Tana Jambaldorj and Ram Sachs. In 2013, <a href="http://zorigsan.mn/en/" target="_blank">Zorig Foundation</a> assumed responsibility for implementing the program. The Zorig Foundation is a Mongolian non-governmental organization dedicated to strengthen human rights, political freedoms, social justice, good governance, and democratic values in Mongolian society.</p>
